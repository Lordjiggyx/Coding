    //take the mehtod and us ethe call method passing in two arguments
    //The first argument is the object that you want ti use the function
    //The second one  being the argument of the the method itself
    console.log(addToThis.call(obj , 1 , 2, 3))//function_name.call(obj , function_arguments)
