however with onreadystatechange both Status and Status values must be checked


Ready state values
//0 - request not initialzed
//1 - server connection established
//2 - request recieved
//3 - processing requests
//4 - request finished and response is ready

Status values
//200= 'OK'
//403 = 'FORBIDDEN'
