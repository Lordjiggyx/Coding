ASYNC JS is pretty much the same concept as what you did in java
with synchronization and calling waits. It is used when you want the 
program running to be able to run and perform different actions without 
waiting for one action to finsh

There are ways of doing async js 

#1 Call backs - Older
preety much just waits for a action/function to compleete before acting


#2 Promises - Newer
