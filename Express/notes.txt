===Getting started=====
Express js is a web framework for node js
to start we must create the package.json file using npm init --yes

Then  install express
npm i -g Express

working like node we must use require to bring express into our project

This module returns a function that must be called 
express()

This function will return an object with plenty of uasble methods
so it's best to store in a variable
const app = express()

the get method is then used 

This takes 2 arguments
1. Route
2. req,res call back

app.get('/' , (req,res)=>
{
    res.send('Hello World')
})

we then need to give it a port to listen too

app.listen(5500)


if you use localhose:5500 it works


 ===Working with express get requests===

--Route Parameters---
can be used ot get data from the user

Yo can pass Parameters into the route of the get method 
and when This occurs you can then pass these Parameters into the url adn tey are sent back to the server

app.get('/example/:name/:age', (req , res)=>
{
    console.log(req.params);
    res.send('example with route params')
})

This returns an object with the values of age and name

however the req becomes an object itself with the propertty of params
which in turn store the Parameters passsed into the url

app.get('/example/:name/:age', (req , res)=>
{
    console.log(req.params);
    res.send(`Your name is ${req.params.name} and you are ${req.params.age} old`)
})


--Query string Parameters--
A query string can be used to create a new Parameters and assifn a value to it 

to do so you need to add a '?' to your url and then the naem of the property and then an '=' to assgin the value nad press enter

http://localhost:5500/example/Tomi/21?Adress=269


if you want to add multiple values you can use the '&' symbol

http://localhost:5500/example/Tomi/21?Adress=269&street=mtEustace


Route paramaters should be used when you must have the data being used query string paramaters are only to be used when you want to give and optional data



===Serving static file susing express==

To start we will require the oath module this helps make life easy
const path = require('path)

You must tehn use the use method this method means you are using middleware

This method takes on a few arguments
1.The alias - to hide the folder name
2.A middleware function called static  that express provides us that leads you to the folder and this takes in the directory name and actual name of the folder in this case being static
3.

app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname , 'static')))

This is the same process with images video mtEustace


====HTTP POST Request with express and body parser module===

This is usally done with forms

The form action requires a route and the form method should be post
jsut like using struts2

in the app.js we msut use ther body parser module to parse the information for us

we must first install using npm intsall body-parser

then we must require it into or app

then use the app.use method with the following statement

bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:false})

this becomes

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:false}))

it parses the data to us and attaches it to the request body

however the data being parsed onto this body must have a name attribute in the html file 

app.post('/' , (req , res)=>
{
    console.log(req.body)
    res.send("Data Saved")
})


====EJS Templates with express==
