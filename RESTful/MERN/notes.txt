===PART 1 - EXPRESS API & MONGODB===

To start we will create our package.json file using 

npm init -y 

We will then go to intstall a number of dependencies

express
body-parser
mongoose
concurrently
nodemon*** might need to save as a dev dependency as not required for production

npm i  --save express body-parser mongoose concurrently

we need ot create to scripts to run the application in the package.json

"start": "node server.js",
"dev": "nodemon server.js",

We can then create our server.js file

---Server.js---

and in this file we can bring express mongoose and body-parser

const express = require("express")
const mongoose = require("mongoose")
const bodyParser = require("body-parser")

we then initialze express to an app variable 

const app = express()

Body parser needs middleware 

app.use(bodyParser.json())

--Connecting to Database--
Rather then using command line for the MongoDB i'm going to use MongoDB compass as it makes htings much easier 

Create a databas and a collection called items 

create item objects with the attributes name author and date



To conect to MongoDB

we need to create a config folder and store our mongo conection url in a file called keys.js

we then use modules.exports 

we let this export an object containing our keys for example the mongo url

module.exports = 
{
    MongoUrl:"mongodb+srv://Tomi:<Lordjiggy123.>@testcluster1-bsyse.mongodb.net/MERN?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
******To get your application to interact with a certain database in atlas after the .mogodb.net/ you must change the vlaue to the name of the database******

we can then bring this into our app.js file and connect to the database

to do this we create a databse variable and allow it to require the keys files and we request the mongo url

const db = require("./Config/keys").MongoUrl

we then use mongoose.connect to connect to the database

this takes in the database variable and an object called useNewUrlParser which must be set to true this returns a promise which we can just console.log the database is Connected and then a catch where we can just log the error

mongoose.connect(db , {useNewUrlParser:true})
.then(()=> console.log("Connected To Database..."))
.catch(err => console.log(err))

We can then create a variable for the port as we may use heroku to deploy it we will set this variable to an environment variable or set it to a local port of 5000

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000

then we can call the app.listem method to start the server passing in the port variable and returning a callback indicating the port is started

app.listen(port , ()=>
{
    console.log(`Server strated on port ${port}`)
})

now we will use npm run dev to strat our server


===Model===

The next thing we will be creating is a model which is a model of our data and the fields we want 

To do this we will create a folder called modles and crete a file called Item.js


In this file we will bring in mongoose and and then create a schema

const mongoose = require("mongoose")

The schema is named after the data so it will be called ItemSchema it will be set to a new mongoose schema

const ItemSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        ...
        ....
        .....
    }

This schemaa object will take a name and date field

we then create an Item variable and then set it to equal the mongoose.schemaa and this will taje in the name of the data baeing created which is an item and the schema that represents it

let Item = mongoose.model("Item" , ItemSchema)

Then we can export this using module.exports

module.exports = Item


===Routes===
We need to creat a folder called routes for our routes in the project and in this folder we will cretae a folder called API

The Api routes will return JSON 

****we are not using a template engine****

in the api older we will create a file called items.js which all our routes will go 

for this file to work we need to include it in our app.js file so the application knows where to look for it 

in our app.js we will create a variable called items.js and require the path of the items.js file 

const Items = require("./Routes/api/items")

we then want to make it so any request targeted at /routes/api to target items.js

To do this we will call app.use() and point to the items file by referencing the variable

//Use Routes
app.use("/Routes/api/", Items)

---Items.js---

We can then go into our items.js and bring in express then we must use the express router 

//Bringing in express
const express = require("express")
//Using express router 
const router = express.Router()


****Export This file using module.exports******


We must then bring in the item model in oirder to manipulate the items 

//Bringing in Item model
const Item = require("../../models/Item")

Now in the items.js file we will create our routes 


---Items routes---

The first route will be a get request to retrieve all items

router.get("/" , (req , res)=>
{
    
})

to fetch all the items in the database

we will first take the model(Item) and then use the find method

this method returns a promise and in this function it will return the items and then we will send a json response using  res.json and pass in items

we can also tag on a .sort() method in order to sort the items by date 1 for ascending and -1 for descending

router.get("/" , (req , res)=>
{
    Item.find()
    .sort({date:-1})
    .then(items =>res.json(items))
})

we then want to create aa route for creating an item this will use router.post 


router.post("/" , (req , res)=>
{

})

in here we will create an item variable set it to be a new item object and we just pass in the name variable from the request which is llowed by using body parser 


router.post("/" , (req , res)=>
{
   const newItem = new Item(
       {
           name: req.body.name
       }
   )
    console.log("Page working")
})

we can then call the newItem.save() method which will save it to the database this returns a promise which returns the object and we will send out a json repsonse seding out the item


router.post("/" , (req , res)=>
{
   const newItem = new Item(
       {
           name: req.body.name
       }
   )

   newItem.save()
   .then(item =>
    {
        res.json(item)
    })
    console.log("Page working")
})


We will then call a delete request This will be based off the id of the item

//Route for deleting a post
router.delete("/:id" , (req , res)=>
{
    //Finiding the Item to delete by ID
   Item.findById(req.params.id)
   //This returns a promise which gives us trhe found item and then a callback of what we want to happen
   .then(item =>
    {
        //We want to use thr remove method on the model and then send a message saying the item was deleted
        Item.remove()
        .then(()=> console.log("Item Deleted"))
        //We then want a catch method this method will return an err and a callback this callback will return a 404 not found message and a messgae to indicate that there was an error
        .catch(err =>res.status(404).send("Error"))
    })
   
 console.log("Page Working")
})


===Part 2 Setting up the Client and Reactstrap====

We will start to work on the front-end focusing on React

To start we need to create a new folder called Client

This is where our react app will go 

in this folder we will use create-react-app . to specify that we want to cretae a a react apploication in this folder

This package.json it creates is different from your package.json in the root folder

****When you are building a full stack app like this you need a proxy value in the package.json in the client folder *****

,
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000/"

This way the application knows what we are talking about when we make calls to the endpoint in

--Run Both Servers--

We then want to run both servers at the same time 

to do this we can use concurrently which wil allow us to run both at the same time

To do this we open the package.json in the server side of the application and then create a few scripts 

"client": "npm start --prefix client" This is to run the client server from the server directory


 "Both": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"npm run client\" " This will allow us to run both servers together the backslahes are used for character escaping 

"client-intstall": "npm install --prefix client" 2 -This is done as if this app is being cloned or moved it will stop the need to reinstall the node_modules folder and run npm install 

this way you can just use npm run client install to install all the client dependencies

so we can now cd back to the root folder and call npm run both

--React Client Side--

In this folder there are extra default things we will delete the following 

logo.svg
index.css

we can go into the app.css and remove the Code

remove any sort of calls that reference deleted files 

in the app.js file we can remove all the code an djust keep the div tag and pss in hello world

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
     <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

We have a few dependencies to add to the application 

we can open a new terminal and go into the client folder

now we want to install 
bootstrap
Reactstrap
uuid used for static data at the moment to genereate random numbers

npm i bootstrap reactstrap uuid react-transition-group

---Components--

We need to import bootsrap into our app.js 

import "../../client/node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"

**Must be at proper directory path**
**If the page does not load turn the server off and on**


We will create a folder called Components in the src folder


-Navbar-
In the Components folder we will creeate a fille called AppNavbar

We will import react and the Component from react 

import React , {Component} from "react"

We will then import a few things from reactstrap

import
{
    Collpase, - This is for teh toggler in the case we add more links to a responsive hamburger menu
    Navbar, - The Navbar
    NavbarToggler, - Used in conjuction to Collpase
    NavbarBrand, - The brand for the Navbar
    Nav, - Wrap around the links
    NavItem, - wrap around nav links
    NavLink, - this wil be where the href is
    Container, bootrap container for everything
} from "reactstrap"

Then we will create our class 

class AppNavbar extends Component
{

    constructor(props)
    {
        super(props)
        this.state = {}
    }


    render()
    {
        
        return(
            <div>

            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default AppNavbar


***We will be passing in props to our navbar so we must pass in props in the navbar and hte super***

We will then create the toggle function 

toggle = () =>
{

}

The toggle funtion here has been set to an arrow function this is a work around for having to bind the the function in the constructor like you usually would and you can do this for any custom function

then in our state we can add isOpen:false , this is the variable that will halp us toggle the hamburger menu 

then in our toggle method we can use this.setState to change the value of isOpen to whatever the oppposite is to allow toglle

toggle = () =>
        {
            this.setState({
                isOpen: !this.state.isOpen
            })
        }

in our render function we will render our navbar using the react Components

First we will place the navbar in the div 

<Navbar color = "success" dark expand = "sm" className="mb-5">
            
</Navbar>

The navbar can take attributes like normal html ones wouls 
color is for the bootstrap colors success = green

expand means that it will become a hamburger menu on small screens as we set it to sm 

className mb-5 means margin-bottom 5

we place dark for the text on the page

we will then place a container in this 
then we can place our NavbarBrand and allow it to have a href to the index page 

<NavbarBrand href = "/">
      The M.E.R.N Shopping List
</NavbarBrand>

Next is the NavbarToggler we give this an onclick and pointit to carry out the toggle method

<NavbarToggler onClick={this.toggle}/>

Then we must add the Collpase we add the isOpen attributes and set it to be the value of isOpen in the state of the clsss we place navabr to let the application know that it's part of a navbar 

<Collapse isOpen = {this.state.isOpen} navbar>

then we add the nav with a class if ml auto just ot make sure that the nav bar is aligned to the left and the link is alligned to the right 

<Nav className = "ml-auto" navbar>

we then add the NavItem link to wrap the link and then the nav item , the nav item taks a href of where you want to send the client with text inside

<NavItem>
    <NavLink href= "https://youtube.com">
        Click To Go to Youtube
    </NavLink>
</NavItem>

In total the AppNavbar looks like this 


 <div>
<Navbar color = "success" dark expand = "sm" className="mb-5">
    <Container>
        <NavbarBrand href = "/">
            The M.E.R.N Shopping List
        </NavbarBrand>
        <NavbarToggler onClick={this.toggle}/>
        <Collapse isOpen = {this.state.isOpen} navbar>
            <Nav className = "ml-auto" navbar>
                <NavItem>
                    <NavLink href= "https://youtube.com">
                        Click To Go to Youtube
                    </NavLink>
                </NavItem>
            </Nav>
        </Collapse>
    </Container>
</Navbar>
</div>


Then we must go into our app.js and import this Component

import AppNavbar from "../src/Components/AppNavbar"

and then in the div we can return the AppNavbar tag 

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
    <AppNavbar></AppNavbar>
    </div>
  );
}



===Part 4 - Shopping list Components and Transitions====

In our Components file we will create a new fille called shopplnnglist.js this will be a class based component

we need to import react 

//Importing react and the components
import React , {Component} from "react"

we need to import things from reactstrap

import {
    Container,
    ListGroup,
    ListGroupItem,
    Button
} from "reactstrap"

Then we need to import things from react-Transition-group
import { CSSTransition , TransitionGroup} from "react-transition-group"


we import uuid for our list items id's
import uuid from "uuid"

We can start by creating the shopplnnglist Component

At the momeent we will hardcode the data into the state 


this.state =
    {
         items:
         [
             {id:uuid() , name: "Chicken"},
             {id:uuid() , name: "Pudding"},
             {id:uuid() , name: "Rice"},
             {id:uuid() , name: "Chicken"}
         ]
    }

in our rrender method we can destructure our state and pull out the items array

 const {items} = this.state

Then in our return we can start by creating a container tag
and in this container we will create a button to add the item 

In the button tag we can add attributes one for the color and an inline style of a margin botttom of 2 rem 

then rather then creating a whole new function to handle the onclick we will use and arrow function 

in this arrow function we will create a variable that will be a prompt for the user to enter a name for the item called name 

then we will create an if statement thhat says if name exists we will change the state but in the this.setState method we will use the spread operatoron the array to add the new object to the array of Items then we close all the tags

 <Container>
                <Button 
                color = "dark"
                style={{marginBottom:"2rem"}}
                onClick = {()=>
                {
                    const name = prompt("enter Item")
                    if(name)
                    {
                        this.setState(state =>
                        (
                            {
                                items:
                                [...state.items,
                                {id:uuid() , name:name}
                                ]
                            }
                        ))
                    }
                }}>
                        Add Item
                </Button>
            </Container>
