## Menu
A control that opens a Drop containing plain Buttons.

The labels and behavior of the contained Buttons are described
      via the `items` property.
      You can provide a single function child that will be called with
      'hover', 'focus', and 'drop' keys. This allows you to customize
      the rendering of the Menu button in those cases.
