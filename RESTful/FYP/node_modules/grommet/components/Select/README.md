**children**

Function that will be called when each option is rendered.
      It will be passed (option, index, options, state) where option
      is the option to render, index is the index of that option in the
      options array, and state is an object with
      { active, disabled, selected } keys indicating the current state

```
function
```

**closeOnChange**

Wether to close the drop when a selection is made. Defaults to `true`.

```

```

**disabled**

Whether the entire select or individual options should be disabled.
        An array of numbers indicates the indexes into 'options' of the
        disabled options. An array of strings or objects work the same way
        as the 'value' to indicate which options are disabled.

```
boolean
[
  number
  string
  object
]
```

**disabledKey**

When the options array contains objects, this property indicates how
      to determine which options should be disabled. If a string is
      provided, it is used as the key for each item object and if that key
      returns truthy, the option is disabled. If a function is provided, it is
      called with the option and the return value determines if the option
      is disabled.

```

**dropProps**

Any valid Drop prop.

```

```

**focusIndicator**

Whether when 'plain' it should receive a focus outline.

```
boolean
```

       not render an icon at all.

```
boolean
function
node
```

**labelKey**

When the options array contains objects, this property indicates how
      to determine the label of each option. If a string is
      provided, it is used as the key to retrieve each option's label.

      to lazily fetch more from the server only when needed.

```
string
element
