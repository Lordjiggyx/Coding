This application is a registration page using node.js exoress passport and mongoose

To start creaet a cluster in MongoDB Atlas 

You need to also xcreate a user as you connect through a url string

To start we use npm init -y to create the package.josn file

Then we must install our dependices

1. Express - our framework
2.Bcrypt.js - Encrypt our passwords
3.Passoport for authentication
4.Any strategy used with passport must be intsalled as a seperate package passport-local
5.ejs - This is our template engine that were using doesn't have layouts so you need express-ejs-layouts
6.Mongoose - to deal with the database we will also use connect-flash for flash messaging and this depends on express-session

npm i express bcrypt passport passport-local passport passport-local ejs express-ejs-layouts mongoose connect-flash express-session

we need to also install a dev dependancy which is nodemon for live reloading

npm i -D nodemon

we will also add a few scripts to run the app

"start": "node app.js",
"dev": "nodemon app.js",

===Creating The Server====
we can then create our app.js file 

We then bring in express

assign it to an application

create a port variable this port variab;e may be deployed so we use process.env.port or local host of 5000

and allow the application to listen on this port variable

we can then type into the terminal and type npm run dev


===Intorducing Routes===

we can create a folder called routes to hold the files we will use for the routes

we can then create two files 

index.js - Home page
users.js - User login and User registration


-Index.js & users.js-

we will be using the express router so we must bring in express


const express = require("express")

Then create a router variable amd llow it to equal the express.router module

const router = express.Router()

we can then use type module.exports = router to make the routers accssable across the app

so now when we want ot create a route we can just use router.<method_name> e,g

router.get
router.post

and the url and callback to follow after it

router.get("/" , (req , res)=>
{
    res.send("Welcome to Browser")
})

This wont work until we make it avaliable in our app.js file

to do this we go into our app.js and create a route

app.use("/" , require("./Routes/index"))

we use app.use and allow it to include the file that is index.js bu using require

we can go to the user class and copy over the code from index.js but just cahnging the location of the page after the slash


//Route for login page
router.get("/login" , (req , res)=>
{
    res.send("Welcome to Login Page")
})

//Route for registeration page
router.get("/register" , (req , res)=>
{
    res.send("Welcome to registration Page")
})


Then we must go back to our app.js and add another route but change it to point towards the users file 

app.use("/users" , require("./Routes/users"))

===Views===

Views allow us to create our UI

To do this we need to bring express layouts into our app.js

const expressLayouts = ("express-ejs-layouts")

we must then bring in our ejs bu usin the app.use and app.set methods

app.use() - will take in the expressLayouts variable

app.set() - will have us set the view engine to be ejs 

We then create a folder called views and then we will need a layout.ejs file to handle the layout of the views

Other files we need is 

Welcome
login
registration
dashboard


We then go to our layout.ejs

and create some boiler plate remember ejs files can read html thus our boiler plate is html

we will be using bootswatch so go to bootswatch.com and pick a theme and insert the url same with fontawesome cdn 


fontawesome code  <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/e9c92827ca.js"></script>

--bootswatch theme--

 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/4.3.1/litera/bootstrap.min.css">

we also need the bootsrap javscript tags


--bootsrap js---

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


we must then place a container in the body and outout any views that are suppossed to be displayed 

to do this we use  <%-body %>

this renders any sort of ejs 

so we can start by going to our welcome.ejs and typing a <h1>Welcome</h1>

then we must go to our index.js and specify the file through the router.get method 
intead of using res.send we use res,,render and this takes in the name of the file we wish to render

The code for the beiwpages were given by brad traversy to speed up tutorial

we then go to the users.js and change the res.send to res.render() and pass in login 


***Notice in the form the value contains ejs it states that if the validation is not passed we want to keep the remaining input values on the form rather then clearing it

for example value="<%= typeof name != 'undefined' ? name : '' %>"


 ****


 ==Connet to database===

 We go to the app.js and require mongoose

const mongoose = require("mongoose")

we then create a config folder and store our mongo conection url in a file called keys.js

we then use modules.exports 

we let this export an object containing our keys for example the mongo url

module.exports = 
{
    MongoUrl:"mongodb+srv://Tomi:<Lordjiggy123.>@testcluster1-bsyse.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}

we can then bring this into our app.js file and connect to the database

to do this we create a databse variable and allow it to require the keys files and we request the mongo url

const db = require("./Config/keys").MongoUrl

we then use mongoose.connect to connect to the database

this takes in the database variable and an object called useNewUrlParser which must be set to true this returns a promise which we can just console.log the database is Connected and then a catch where we can just log the error

mongoose.connect(db , {useNewUrlParser:true})
.then(()=> console.log("Connected To Database..."))
.catch(err => console.log(err))

Then we need to create the models 

create a folder called models and a file inside called User

inside this file we can create a schema with all the fields the user needs

so in the User.js file 

we first require mongoose 

then w create a varibale to store the User fields  in a schema
using mongoose.schema

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema()

in this method we pass in an object containing the fields
 of the user each with it's own type and whether it i required or not


const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        name:{
            type:String,
            required :true
        },
        email:{
            type:String,
            required :true
        },
        Passowrd:{
            type:String,
            required :true
        },
        date:{
            type:Date,
            //This creates a default value for the date if it is not set
            default :Date.now
        }
    }
)

we will put this in a variable by creating a model from the schema using mongoose.model() you pass in the model naem being user and the UserSchema

const User = mongoose.model("User" , UserSchema)

and then you can just export this

module.exports = User


===Registration===
since we are garbbing data from the form we must bring in our body parser 

app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}))
this means we can get data fom our form using req.body

we then go to our users.js file

when we submit the reg form we make a post request to the /users/register so we must create a handler for this request

we must use router.post("/register, (req,res)=>
{

})

we can pull variabled from the body using 

const {name , email , password , password2} = req.body


we must use router.post("/register, (req,res)=>
{
    const {name , email , password , password2} = req.body
})

we will thhen create an array to hold our error messages called error and everytime an error occurs we will push a message into it

We will check the required fields using if statements 

if(!name || !email || !password || !password2)
{
    error.push({
        msg: "Please fill in all fields"
    })
}

we will then check the passwords match

if(password !== password2 )
{
    error.push({
        msg: "passwords dont match"
    })
}

rest of the validation is slef explanatory

if there is an error we wan to re render the register page with the information that has already been passed in

when using ejs we can pass in values


    res.render("register" , 
    {
        
    }

    we wnat to pass in the errors and also the data being filled in on the form we will pass this in as an object

    if(error.length > 0)
{
    res.render("register" , 
    {
        error,
        name,
        email,
        password,
        password2

    })
}
else
{
    res.send("pass")
}

})

This if statement re renders the page passing in whatever information has been entered in the form if there is an errors
but idf there is no error the page retuerns pass at the moment to let the user know that the form was filled out sucessfully


    we need to include a partial message in our views 

    this is just some html that we want to put inside another template file

    we need to create a folder called partials in our views folder

    we create a mesages file and indide this file we will check if the errors exist

    using this ejs

    <%if(typeof errors != "undefined"){%>
<% errors.forEach(function(error){
%>
<%= error.msg%>
<%})%>
<%}%>

then in your register.ejs file you need ot palkce the following line to include the ejs

<% include ./partials/messages %>

ejs is fucking bogey every line needs an open and close tag so be weary of that


We will then wrap these messages in the bootstrap alert mark up

we can go to bootstrao.com find componenets and then dismissing 

we can then grab that code and then plaec it in our messages file where the error.msg is  we then csn replace the line of text which the error.msg we orginally had


so our code will look like this

<%if(typeof errors != "undefined"){%>
<% errors.forEach(function(error){
%>
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    <%= error.msg%>
    <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
    </button>
  </div>
<%})%>
<%}%>



====Adding to the Database===

We must now go to the users route and start to work in the elese block after the validation passes


To do this we will use thr model 
mongoose works by letting you createa model and then allowing you to call mehtods on that model

so first thing is we bring in the user at the top of the file

//user model
const User = require("../routes/users.js")

now we can call methods on the user

before submitting the user we want to check that don't already exist

we will use the findOne() method the query inside will check for a matching email as there cannot be the same email in any sort of a system so this will look like this


email is the variable we cretaed at the top of the post method by pulling it from the body of the form

else
{
    //Validation passed
    User.findOne(
        {
            email:email
        }
    )
}

this will retuen a promise so we must use .then and this promise will gove use the user and we will call a method to check for that user that exists if we find a user then we want to do the same thing and re render the form and send an error

to this we will take the code from if the passwords do not match and place it in an if statement that says "If the user exists" 


 User.findOne(
        {
            email:email
        }
    )
    .then(user =>
        {
            //User with same passwword exists
            if(user)
            {
                //passing on a message to  indicate exitsting user
                errors.push({
                    msg: "User with this email already exists"
                })
                //Re rendering the form
                res.render("register" , 
                {
                    errors,
                    name,
                    email,
                    password,
                    password2
            
                })
            }

if the a user without this email address we will create a new one in an else block i want ot Encrypt the password so we will use bcrypt

//bringing in bcrypt
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt")



back to the post method in the else block we will create an ew user by creating a variable called newUser and assigning it to new User

const newUser = new User({})

***When haev a model and you want to create a new instance we want to use the new keyword and pass in the values***


const newUser = new User({
    name,
    email,
    password
})

now to encrpyt the password we need to generate a salt to create a hash there are two methods we will use 

the bcrypt.genSalt this takes in a 10 and then a call back with an wrror and a salt this call back will call the bcrpyt.hash method this will take in our password and the salt this will also give use a call back with a possible error we will set the newuser password to the hash value 

we can then call the save method on this user as this is method in the mongoose models 

this will return a promise in which we will redirect the user to the login page 

and then we will catch any errors


The else final  block will look like so

else
            {
                //Creating a new user
                const newUser = new User({
                    name,
                    email,
                    password
                })
               
                console.log(newUser)

                //Hash passowrd

                bcrypt.genSalt(10 , (err ,salt)=>
                {
                bcrypt.hash(newUser.password , salt ,(err , hash)=>{
                   if(err)
                  throw err

                  //set passowrd to hashed
                  newUser.password =hash
                  //save User
                  newUser.save()
                  .then(user=>
                    {
                        res.redirect("/users/login")
                    })
                  .catch(err =>
                    {
                        throw err
                    })
                        
                    })
                })
            }





===Flash method after redirect===

To display a message after the redirect we need to use a flash message which stotres the message in session and then displays after the redirect 

to do this we have to go to app.js and implement connect.flash

we need to also bring in express session in app.js

//Bringing in flash message
const flash = require("connect-flash")
//Bringing in express session
const session = require("express-session)

is alsos requires it's own middleware
can be taken from express documentation
// Express session
app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'secret',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: true
  })
)

we need to also need middleware for connect flash which is 

// Connect flash
app.use(flash());


we should now have acesss to request .flash we wan different colours for different messages so we will create global variables to do this we msut add our own middleware using app.use

inside this will be a function taht takes in request response and next variables and then return a function

we can set the global variables using res.locals.<Variable_name> and then set it to request.flash

here we have done that for the error and success messages

finally we need to call next 

app.use((req , res , next)=>
{
    res.locals.success_msg = req.flash("sucess_msg")
    res.locals.error_.sg = req.flash("error_msg")
    next()
})

so now if we go to our users.js in thew redirect we want to clal the flash message just before it

the req.flash takes two paarameters the variable name and the output you wish to display

 //save User
                  newUser.save()
                  .then(user=>
                    {
                        //Showing the success message 
                        req.flash("success.msg","You have been registered and can now log in!!!")
                        //redirecting the user to the login page
                        res.redirect("/users/login")
                    })

This creates the flash message we need to go into our messages.js 

We will check if the success messgae exists in the first place this means that the validation must be fully passed as this is when and only when the success mesg is created

<% } %> <% if(error_msg != ''){ %>

and then we will copy the same information as the last message but chsnge from alert-warning to alert-success

and then change the inside message to match the global variable success_msg

<% } %> <% if(error_msg != ''){ %>
  <div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    <%= success_msg%>
    <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
    </button>
  </div>
  <%}%>

  and then repeat for error message

  we need to finally grab the partial from register.js and place it in login .js

  <% include ./partials/messages %>
