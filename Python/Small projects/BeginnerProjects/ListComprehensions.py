#Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
#  a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
#  Write one line of Python that takes this
#  list a and makes a new list that has only
#  the even elements of this list in it.

#List comprehension
# A list comprehension behaves like this: [output] for [item] in [list] if [filter]

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print([b for b in a if b % 2 == 0])
