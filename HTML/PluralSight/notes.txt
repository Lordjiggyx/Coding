a defintion list is made using 
the dl declares the definition list

the dt is for the definiton item
and the dd is used for the defintion

<dl>
    <dt>...</dt>
    <dd>...<dd>
</dl>

you can use styles to a list in order to make it more modern and interactvie

-----Linking documents-----

There are three types of anchor tags


source - <a href> this means the content inside the anchor is a clickable link taht the browser will find

target - <a name =" "> - This provides a target in the docunent that can be linked again

implicit anchor- <div id = "article"> id's can be used as targets as you can call on the id


There are two types of hyperlinks taht can be used when linking documents

absolute - The full specific url 
relative - This is an impartial url used when the documents are together on a particlur server or file
e.g.

href = "./content/locations.html"


To link within a document all you have to do is link it to the id or sematic tag
e.g.

<a href = "#loc2>Location 2 </a>

<div id = "location">
    <div id= "loc1>First</div>
    <div id= "loc2>Second</div>
</div>

if the div a tag with location is clicked it will bring you to the point in the page where the id is equal to loc 2


These can be combined using the relative and hash symbol

<a href = "locations.htmll#loc2">

You can also just use an empty a name tag near the part of the document you want to direct a link to

e.g.

<a href = #cocoa>Hot Cocoa</a>

<a name = "cocoa">
