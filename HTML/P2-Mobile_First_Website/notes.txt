JQuery - for smart scroling
JS - Also for smart scrolling

This site is meant to replicate a photography website

Mobile first is an approcah to design 
it means that we start with a mobile small view
and then make it adaptt to larger screens
Bootstrap 4 has adopted this methodlogy

Viewport in meta data is very important for the Responsiveness of the site

Strong tags used to make text bold

script is using JQuery so this must be included

to do theis we go to code.jquery.com 
and grab the minified version 3 and copy the script tag above our script tag

<script
  src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"
  integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo="
  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

  <script src=js/main.js></script>


  The split when the scereen is made largerfor the landing is acheived using flexbox
  when you display something as flex it automatically turns into a flex row which weill
  go horizontal instead of vertically we will do this using a media query

  ---Media Query---
  Works like a function
  Css only works at the specified sizes

  used by saying

  @media(min-width:500px)
  {
      #landing{
          display:flex;
          height:100%
      }
  }


  --Smooth scroling--

  Smooth scrolling is done in the main js file

it grabs onto the id of the view work button
this will activate a function
and this function will cause the scrolling

the function has a variable called images this varibale is set to the postion of the images id and the top postion

the jquery will animate the body as it will scroll from the top
this takes in the time it needs to do the animattion


// Animate Smooth Scroll
$('#view-work').on('click', function() {
  const images = $('#images').position().top;

  $('html, body').animate(
    {
      scrollTop: images
    },
    900
  );
});
