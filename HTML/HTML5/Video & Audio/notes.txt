2 methods

#1 - include video from root folder
#2 - include video from another web link using embed video


Method 1 -source folder

First use a video tag

<video>

lead the src to the path of the required video

There are a number of attributes that we can include in the tag

for example

autoplay = Decides whetether the vidoe starts when the page is entered

poster - Decides on a thumbnail for the video

controls- adds the video controls 

loop - allows for repeating of a video

mute - mutes the video

preload - gievs the brbowser a hint on how the page should load
there are three options :
preload ="auto" - video should load with the page
preload = "none" - video should not load when the page is rendered
preload = "metadata" - believes the video should only load metadada

there is also a track attribute that can be used to add captions
the video however must be .vtt to stream the video text file

<track default
                src="./Video/16 How to Create HTML5 Videos and Embed Videos  Learn HTML and CSS  HTML Tutorial  Basics of CSS.vtt"
                kind="captions"
                srclang="en"
                label="English Captions"
                
                />

To check the vido format that is allowed we can use the source tag insid ethe video tag

inside this source tag with the type attribute we say video with a "/" and the type of format
then writing a message for the user
 e.g.

 <video controls>
            <!--Checking if the source file format is supported-->
            <source src="./Video/16 How to Create HTML5 Videos and Embed Videos  Learn HTML and CSS  HTML Tutorial  Basics of CSS.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        BROWSER DOES NOT SUPPORT MP4 
        </video>


        we can change the width of the video by using our css selectors and adjusting the width


Method 2 - link to video


we do this using embedding 

to take a video from youtube we can just go to the share button on it and choose embed

and then take the given code

and put it in your container class


to change the width and height of an iframe tag we must place the iframe in a div 

then set the postion of this div to relative

we then set the padding bottom to a % thena dd the hight of the container which sclaes to it's own width. by setting the padding to 56.25% we then have a 16:9 scalling for the video size

.videowrapper
{
 position: relative;
 padding-bottom: 56.25%;
 padding-top: 25px;
 height: 0;;
}

then we take the i frame and set the postion to absolute
we then must set its postion 0 on all 4 sides to strech it to fit the container

and set the height and width to 100%

.videowrapper iframe
{
 position: absolute;
 top:0;
 bottom: 0;
 left: 0;
 right: 0;
 width: 100%;
 height: 100%;
}

To add closed captions you must use a trcak tag 
and
