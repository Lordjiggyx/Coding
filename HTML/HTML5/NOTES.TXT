----Fallbacks and polyfills-----

Used when there are api's unavaliable

html5please can be helped to be used to help with these polyfills
and fall backs gvinh us possible fallbacks and polyfills


-----Selection API-----

document.getElementByClassName = allows you to get the element by class name returns a live result


document.querySelector =query selector take in a CSS3 selector returning the first match it finds in the page this returns a static result

e.g. document.querySelector (.page-headers)

document.querySelectorAll = returns all the matches of the css3 selector passed in

****Query selector all will alwys return an array if no results it will return an empty array

however it doesnt't exactly return an array intead it returns a nodelist 
this means it does not contain the same capabilities of an array for example
you cant iterate through it with a for loop

---Iterate through a nodeList---

you can do this using a for loop

done the same way as usual

for(int i = 0 ; i < nodelist.length; i++)
{
    console.log(nondelist[i].innerText)
}

or can be done using the for each method

first you must set access to the method

var forEach = Array.prototypr.forEach

var items = document.querySelectorAll(#page-headers li)

you must them call the method taking in two paramenters

the first being the list and the second is the function you want to happen as you iterate thtough

forEach.call(items , item=>()
{
    console.log(item.innerText)
})

maxlength = true when a value lenght is longer than the set maxlength attribute

range:

which creates focus on a certain element


-----HTML5 MEDIA----
 3 parts:
 media element - audio or video
 media types 
 speech api - application responding to text


if you do not serve the video files with the matching content type then browser will not know how to
proces the video


To allow video or audi can be controlled you must add the controls attribute to use them


<video controls wdith "900">
    .....
    .....
    .....
    .....
</video>
<audio controls wdith "900">
    .....

    .....
    .....
    .....
    .....

------Drawing states , charts etc-----

canvas is drawing surface in the web page

canvas is a merge of the html element and a javascript api

it is based off a grid system

positive values are in the east and south of the axis 
ehile negative are in the north and west


YOU MUST FIRST SPECIFY THE CANVAS ELEMENT IN THE HTML ASSIGNNING A WIDTH AND A HEIGHT

then you use the javascript

To use canvas the first thing to do is to use the 


****context.beginPath()**** method

next you tell it where to start of using context.moveTo(x,y) x nad y being the coordinates

then you specify where you want the line context.lineTo(x,y )

then you can use the context.fill() method this connects the firrst point ot the last point
and fills it with a colour

you can also use context.fillstyle to set the color of the object before you use the context.fill()

paint an image onto the canvas you 
must get the context and set it to 2d
then create a new image object
then onload the image in the function stating where you want the img drawn
then you must point to the img sourc location

context = canvas.getContext("2d")

var img = new Image();
img.onload = function()
{
    context.drawImage(img , 0 , 0)
}

img.src=img.home.jpg

to scale the image you must use the 

context.scale() method and pass in the zoom size you want to scale the image to

if you use decimals it will make the image smaller 
if you use whole numbers it will make the image bigger snd zoom in


to rotate an image all you have to do is to us ethe context.rotate method this takes in radians
and if you want to use degrees you must use a helper function to convert radians to degrees

you can animate the canvas search this online
