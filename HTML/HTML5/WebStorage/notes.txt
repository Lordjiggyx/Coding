There are two types of web storage

Session storage 
Local storage

They have same methods and properties the only differnece is session storage 
gets deleted when you close the browser or log out delete the tab etc

Local storgae will stay until you go into the browser settings and delet it 
or you use a method to delete the information

*****Done Within A javascipt file*****

They both exist the window object so you can use the metjod localStorgae or SessionStorage attached to the window object

to see the storage right click and press inspect 
Then go to the application tab

Local storgae and session storagecan be seen on the side bar

These are estentially like key value pairs

they can take any type of object

the only probelm however is that the value being placed into local storage must be a string

That's where the JSON Object comes in they allow us to convert objects to strings and vice versa



---How to put something into local storage----

There is a setItem() method

it asks for a key and a value setItem('user' , 'Tomi Ilori')


There is also a get item method that will allow us to retrieve information from local storage but must be a variable first

let user = window.localStorgae.getItem("user")
console.log(user)

when saving an array to local storage we must use the JSON object

we let a variable equal the JSON object
this object has two methods
parse - Takes a string and extracts the objects 
Stringify - Takes an object and turns it into a string

in this case we will use Stringify
and then pass in the variable

let usersString = JSON.stringify(users)

window.localStorage.setItem("user" , usersString)


to retrieve the orginal information we let a variable equal the string and then use JSON.parse to create the object
