We have a main container component

in this component we have 4 smaller screens 

-The sign in form
The sign up form
The sign in overlay
The sign up overlay

At one moment you can see either

The sign in form alongside the sign up overlay
the sign up form alongside the sign in overlay

Explanation of the overlay

The overlay container:
this will display the visvle area at a certain time it has a width of 50% of the total containers width

The overlay:
this div has a double width size =200% so this takes the full width of the main container

The overlay panels:
These divs are holding the actual content(text and button) they both have a postion of absolute meaning we can postion them 
wherever we want in the .overlay conmponent , one to the left and one to the right. both have a width of 50% of the overlay component

****Check out picture in linke******

This is the overlay container layer this acts as a focus area alowwing us to hide the panel which is overflowing 
This is why the overlay must be twice as big ,
by moving around the overlay container we can hide or show which panel we want


The Forms animation
we have two containers the .formcontainers and each have a width of 50% we must mover them at the same time from the left to the right
when they get behind the overlay-container we chnage the z-index which is the 3d postioning of the panel so the 
form will either move on top or move underneath
