We will use HTML5 Semantic tags
They are used to let the browser know waht content is where

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp -Link for better explanation

When making a responsive website it is important we set the viewport
This will set the width of the website
usually this is done when you use the html:5 shorcut

Also good to have SEO in the html to make the site more reachable

Wrapping elements in a container allows for them to have margin so they do not
extend all the way to the side of the webpage

---General rule of thumb for calsses and id's---

An ID is for something that is unique for example a showcase area

A class is somehing that will be used repeatedly

for images you use img src not a href

--css---
overflow hidden meand that if something oes out of the div it stays hidden rathee rthan making a scroll bar

You can target a certain piece if css using the span tag the css must have a class that can be referneced in the html file

you can set the type of input required for somehing using input[tyoe='']

To make a site responsive we use media querys 
this means that the css will only work if the site is a certain width
