To start off mostly everything will be done in the css file
in the html file we just use a div with class of box

The postition of the object being moved around should be set to relative

we will use a numbver of properties 

#1-Animation-name - name of the aniumation
#2-Animation-duration - the duration of the Animation in seconds

We take the name of the animation and make a keyframe

a key frame is made with the @keyframes e.g.

@keyframes myanimation
{

}

We then declare at what percent the kind of style we want 
****This must be done within curly braces****
@keyframes myanimation
{
/*At what percent do we want a certain style */
    0%{background-color: white}
    0%{background-color: white}
    0%{background-color: white}
    0%{background-color: white}
    100%{background-color: white}
}

There are loads of properties that can be used 

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation.asp

We can animate the position by simply indictaing how many
pixlels we ant it to move at a given point in the animation
the two most common ones are left and top but you can also use bottom and right
 you can use "transform(x, y)" to move elements on the page instead of top or left

@keyframes myanimation
{
/*At what percent do we want a certain style */
    0%{background-color: white;left: 0px; top: 0px}
    25%{background-color: red;left: 300px; top: 0px}
    50%{background-color: green ;left: 300px; top: 300px}
    75%{background-color: blue;left: 0px; top: 300px}
    100%{background-color: white;left: 0px; top: 0px}
}


We can also manipulate the shpae of the object an example would be using border radius
@keyframes myanimation
{
/*At what percent do we want a certain style */
    0%{background-color: white;left: 0px; top: 0px;border-radius:  0 0 0 0 }
    25%{background-color: red;left: 300px; top: 0px;border-radius:  50% 0 0 0 }
    50%{background-color: green ;left: 300px; top: 300px;border-radius:  50% 50% 0 0 }
    75%{background-color: blue;left: 0px; top: 300px;border-radius:  50% 50% 50% 0 }
    100%{background-color: white;left: 0px; top: 0px;border-radius:  50% 50% 50% 50% }
}

This property has for values being the 4 corners of an element

We can also cause an animation to repeat itself using animation-iteration-count
this is actually done within the box class and not the key frame
We can also delay the animation using animation-delay
We can also change the direction using animation-direction 

.box{
    background: white;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: relative;
    animation: myanimation 4s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-delay: 2s;
    animation-direction: reverse;
}


We can play with the timing of the object to change the way it moves
using the animation-timing-function
it has a lot of values that it can be set to

linear-moves at the same speed
ease-in-Start slow end fast
ease-out-start fast end slow

To keep the aninmation shape the way it ends at the cycle 
you can use animation-fill-mode-forwards


*****Transitions******

Transitions are different they need a trigger for it to occur
for example hover

to alter this we use the name of the element class and then the requested action that
will trgger the action ,active

.box:hover{
    background:red;
}

List of editable properties

TRANSITIONAL PROPERTIES
-Properties that have an identifiable halfway point

background-color 
background-position 
border-color 
border-width 
border-spacing 
bottom 
color
font-size 
font-weight 
height left 
letter-spacing 
line-height 
margin 
max-height 
max-width 
min-height 
min-width 
opacity 
outline-color 
outline-offset 
outline-width 
padding right 
text-indent 
text-shadow 
top 
vertical-align 
visibility 
width 
word-spacing 
z-index */

in the actual box class we must define what properties we want to add
to the Transition

for example

.box{
    background: white;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    position: relative;
    margin: auto;
    top: 200px;
    transition-property: background;
    transition-duration: 3s;
    
}

we can separate the duration for the different animations
transition-duration: 1s , 2s;
1s to chnage color
2s to change shape


*****Transform***
This is declared in the box class and then in the transition:hover 

 transition-property: background , border-radius,
    transform;

Transform has a number of properties including rotate , scale etc

transform: rotateY(180deg)


You can use transition-property :all
