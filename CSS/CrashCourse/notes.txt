Css is used for desgining and layouts
 -Not a programming language
 -Stylesheet/sty;ing language

 ----Three ways of using Css---

 -Inline CSS: directly in the HTML element
 <h1 style = "color:red">Hello World</h1>

 -Internal CSS: Using <style> tags within a single document
Refers to the element/ tag using the style tag
Place the style tag in the head tag of the page and add 
the requested attribute

 -External CSS : linking an external .css file
 in the css file we again make a refernece to the specfic 
 attribute or element we want to edit and then use the 
 html tag called <link> placed in the head of the file


 ---CSS Selectors----
a { Background-color : yellow; }

a = Selector/link
{ = declaration start
Background-color = property
: = property/value separator
; = declaration separator
} = declaration end

--ID/Class---
-ID's are unique elements e.g "main navigation bar"

-Classes are used when the style may be applied more than once 
-You should not repeat ID'S

When referencing ID'S in CSS you use the "#"
e.g. #mainbar

e.g. .mainbar

Border - Border propertyto stop elements interacting
Margin - The space outside of an element

---Text formatting---
Allows you to choose specfically what tag you want to style in the spefic class

----links---

-Relative - positioned to it's normal postion falls naturally
-Absolute - Target whatever postion we want
-Fixed- fixed to one postion
-Intial - sets to initial postion
-Inherit- inherits property of parent
