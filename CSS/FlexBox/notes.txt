Used to align componenets beetter
responisve to mobile
easier to Use


lets start 

mostly done in containers 

there is a general container and then 
child elements in this container that
are manipulated using flex

for example 

.container-1{
display :flex;
}
*****Display flex must be put in containers to assign the flex variables

display flex is used to align side by side 

you can use flex on it's own to edit the size of these elements

e.g.

.box{
flex:1;
}

******Arrangement/Order*******

To change the order of objects we can use order
e.g

.box-1{
flex: 1;
order:2
}

.box-2{
flex: 1;
order:3

}

.box-3{
flex: 1;
order:1

}


*****Alignment*****

We can use align to align the height of the elements due to content

using align there's multiple values for align e.g.
align-items
align-content
align-self

Each of these have thier own set of values
e.ge.
flex-start
flex-end
center
strech

e.g.

.container-1
{
display: flex;
align-items: flex-start
align-content:
}

*********Direction/Horizontal/Columns******

You can do this by using flex Direction

can set the flex direction to either Column or row

.container-1{
display :flex;
flex-direction:column;
}


*****Margin/Width********

we can use width

.container-2-box
{
    width: 20%;
}
we can use flex-basis too
.container-2-box
{
    flex-basis: 20%;
}

Margins can be done by using justify-content
justify-content has it's own set of values
e.g

flex-start
flex-end
center
space-between - This one allows the whole page to be taken up if there is empty space
space-around-Does the same thing but adds margins around the elements


To allow flexibility between devices we can use a media query around the container
this makes the size more responisve
 @media(min-width:769px)
        {
            .container-1
            {
            display: flex;

            }
            .container-2
            {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between
            }
        }


***********Wrapping***********************
we can wrap elements using flex-wrap

flex-wrap has it's own values 
the most common being wrap

.container-3
            {
            display: flex;
            flex-wrap: wrap
            }

Much More Practice needed when you try this yourself
